                                            World war II in the Pasific ended after the Hirosima and Nagasaki bombings. The empire of Japan ended to allies aboard USS Missouri in 1945. It inspired the East Indies (Indonesian) Nationalist to proclaim independence, which the Japanese had promised. Soon the leader of The Indonesian nationalist movement insisted that Sukarno, as soon of a school teacher and theosophist, and Hatta a Sumatra Economist proclaim Indonesian Independence on the August 17th, 1945. They were also appointed President and vise  President of the new nation.       After the Japanese fled from the East Indies the Dutch came back to recover the territory. They realized that the east Indies was very important for the Dutch economy. Armed with Japanese weapon, the nationalists declared war on the Dutch. However with the modern weapon, the Dutch were able to make significant headway in Sumatra and Java.       The Dutch aggression came under much criticism from the united nation. They proposed a negotiation between the Dutch and the Indonesion nationalist movement and both sides agreed to negotiate. Eventually, a conference of 120 delegates was held in the Hague (Dutch: Den Haag) in 1449. The Indonesion nationalist delegates were led by Muhammad Hatta. After ten weeks of meeting, both side reached an agreement by which the Dutch recognised the sovereignty of the united States of Indonesia, with queen Juliana as the titular head of an Indonesian Dutch union.

                                            Are organically grown foods the best choices? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and marketed food products are now being debated. Advocates of organic foods – a term whose meaning varies greatly – frequently proclaim that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of the typical North American diet is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been sparkled by sweeping claims that the food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, the preponderance of written material advancing such claims makes it difficult for the general public to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting entirely of organically grown food prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely publicized and form the basis for folklore. Almost daily the public is besieged by claims for ‘no – aging’ diets, new vitamins, and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated reports that natural vitamins are superior to synthetic ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than fumigated grains, and the like. One thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better nutritional quality than conventionally grown foods. So there is real cause for concern if consumers, particularly those with limited incomes, distrust the regular food supply and buy only expensive organic food instead.

                                            Rengasdengklok Incident The Rengasdengklok Incident is known as the kidnapping of Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta, which took place the day before the proclamation of Indonesia's Independence. The background of this incident was due to differences of opinion between the young and the old groups regarding the proclamation of Indonesian Independence on August 17, 1945. At that time, the young group wanted Soekarno and Hatta to immediately proclaim Indonesia's Independence because Japan had surrendered to the Allies. However, the elders were against it because there were still many things to consider such as security. Impatient, young groups such as Chaerul Saleh, Sukarni, and Wikana along with Shodanco Singgih (a member of PETA) and other youths decided to secure Soekarno and Hatta to Rengasdengklok on the grounds of keeping them away from Japanese influence. On August 16, 1945 at around 3 a.m., young groups "kidnapped" Soekarno and Hatta from Jakarta and took them to Rengasdengklok, an area in Karawang, West Java. In Rengasdengklok, Soekarno and Hatta were urged to immediately proclaim independence. Soekarno refused. Knowing that Soekarno was kidnapped by young group, Achmad Soebarjo tried to solve the problem. There was a negotiation between the young and the old groups. The result was that the proclamation of independence should be implemented in Jakarta. Then Achmad Soebarjo asked young group to immediately bring Soekarno and Hatta back to Jakarta. He also promised that the proclamation of Indonesian Independence would be immediately proclaimed without Japanese influence. The agreement made Yusuf Kunto and Achmad Soebarjo go to Rengasdengklok to pick up Soekarno and Hatta back to Jakarta. In the evening, the group arrived in Jakarta. Soekarno and Hatta were escorted to Admiral Maeda's house on Jalan Imam Bonjol, Central Jakarta, which is now the Formulation of Proclamation Text Museum. They used his house to make the text of the proclamation of Indonesia. The text was formulated by Soekarno, Hatta, and Achmad Soebarjo. Then it was given to Sayuti Melik to be typed. Then accompanied by B. M. Djah, Sayuti Melik typed the text of the proclamation. After that, the text was handed back to Soekarno and Hatta for signature. Then on August 17, 1945 at 10 a.m. Soekarno who was accompanied by Hatta read the text of Proclamation at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur 56, Jakarta. 1.

They realized that the east Indies was very important for the Dutch economy. Armed with Japanese weapon, the nationalists declared war on the Dutch.

                            18. Are organically grown foods the best choices? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and marketed food products are now being debated. Advocates of organic foods – a term whose meaning varies greatly – frequently proclaim that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of the typical North American diet is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been sparkled by sweeping claims that the food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, the preponderance of written material advancing such claims makes it difficult for the general public to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting entirely of organically grown food prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely publicized and form the basis for folklore. Almost daily the public is besieged by claims for ‘no – aging’ diets, new vitamins, and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated reports that natural vitamins are superior to synthetic ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than fumigated grains, and the like. One thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better nutritional quality than conventionally grown foods. So there is real cause for concern if consumers, particularly those with limited incomes, distrust the regular food supply and buy only expensive organic food instead. The word ‘advocates’ in the passage is closest in meaning to which of the following: A. Proponents B. Merchants C. Inspectors D. Consumers E. employer​</h2><br />

                            30. Rengasdengklok Incident The Rengasdengklok Incident is known as the kidnapping of Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta, which took place the day before the proclamation of Indonesia's Independence. The background of this incident was due to differences of opinion between the young and the old groups regarding the proclamation of Indonesian Independence on August 17, 1945. At that time, the young group wanted Soekarno and Hatta to immediately proclaim Indonesia's Independence because Japan had surrendered to the Allies. However, the elders were against it because there were still many things to consider such as security. Impatient, young groups such as Chaerul Saleh, Sukarni, and Wikana along with Shodanco Singgih (a member of PETA) and other youths decided to secure Soekarno and Hatta to Rengasdengklok on the grounds of keeping them away from Japanese influence. On August 16, 1945 at around 3 a.m., young groups "kidnapped" Soekarno and Hatta from Jakarta and took them to Rengasdengklok, an area in Karawang, West Java. In Rengasdengklok, Soekarno and Hatta were urged to immediately proclaim independence. Soekarno refused. Knowing that Soekarno was kidnapped by young group, Achmad Soebarjo tried to solve the problem. There was a negotiation between the young and the old groups. The result was that the proclamation of independence should be implemented in Jakarta. Then Achmad Soebarjo asked young group to immediately bring Soekarno and Hatta back to Jakarta. He also promised that the proclamation of Indonesian Independence would be immediately proclaimed without Japanese influence. The agreement made Yusuf Kunto and Achmad Soebarjo go to Rengasdengklok to pick up Soekarno and Hatta back to Jakarta. In the evening, the group arrived in Jakarta. Soekarno and Hatta were escorted to Admiral Maeda's house on Jalan Imam Bonjol, Central Jakarta, which is now the Formulation of Proclamation Text Museum. They used his house to make the text of the proclamation of Indonesia. The text was formulated by Soekarno, Hatta, and Achmad Soebarjo. Then it was given to Sayuti Melik to be typed. Then accompanied by B. M. Djah, Sayuti Melik typed the text of the proclamation. After that, the text was handed back to Soekarno and Hatta for signature. Then on August 17, 1945 at 10 a.m. Soekarno who was accompanied by Hatta read the text of Proclamation at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur 56, Jakarta. 1.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Pada tanggal 6 Agustus 1945, sebuah bom atom dijatuhkan di kota Hiroshima di Jepang oleh Amerika Serikat.  Itu mendemoralisasi semangat tentara Jepang di dunia.  Keesokan harinya, Panitia Kemerdekaan Indonesia mengukuhkan keinginan untuk mencapai kemerdekaan Indonesia.  Pada tanggal 9 Agustus 1945, bom atom kedua dijatuhkan di Nagasaki, menyebabkan Jepang menyerah kepada Amerika Serikat dan sekutunya.  Pada 14 Agustus 1945, Jepang secara resmi menyerah kepada Sekutu di atas kapal USS Missouri.  Mendengar hal tersebut, sekelompok muda mendesak para lansia untuk segera memproklamasikan kemerdekaan Indonesia.  Namun, para lansia tidak mau terburu-buru.  Beberapa konsultasi dilakukan dalam beberapa hari pertemuan.  Mereka kemudian menyiapkan teks Proklamasi Kemerdekaan Indonesia.  Keesokan paginya, tanggal 17 Agustus 1945, Soekarno membacakan teks Proklamasi Kemerdekaan Indonesia.  Kemudian bendera Indonesia dikibarkan, dilanjutkan dengan sambutan oleh Soewirjo, Wakil Walikota Jakarta.  Itu adalah tanda kemerdekaan suatu negara</p><p></p><p> 1. Sebutkan teks struktur tentang!
