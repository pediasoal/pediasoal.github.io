                                            The lion and the mouse A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her."Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free."You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion."Bantuin bikin direct speech ke indirect speech tolong</a>

                                            tolong bantuin isi ya.. ini teks nya..Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday. One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!” “We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said. They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger. “Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy. Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said. become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip. Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits. “I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town. “There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.” At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace. “Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?” “Here I am, at your feet.” “Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?” “Please let me be your retainer.” “I wonder if your very small body can do anything.” “I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee. “Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.” “Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong. One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess.“Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi. Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer. “Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked. “Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry. “Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said. “Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wishthat I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!” And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</a>

They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger. “Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy. Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said. become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip. Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits. “I’m going now,” Issumboshi said. “Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off. Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body. … … … At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town. “There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.” At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace. “Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?” “Here I am, at your feet.” “Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?” “Please let me be your retainer.” “I wonder if your very small body can do anything.” “I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee. “Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.” “Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong. One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi. Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer. “Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked. “Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry. “Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said. “Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!” And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi. The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after. artinya​</a>

Find the meaning of the bolded words Then answer the questions!Proverbs exist in every language and culture and are a way of passing down folk wisdom, or “ common sense “, from generation to generation. Who doesn’t remember a time when they were struggling with a problem or dilemma, and someone quoted a proverb that aptly summed up or explained the situation? “ All’s fair in love and war “, describe the injustice that is often encountered in romantic relationship and may help some of us accept it. “ Absence makes the heart grow fonder “, its meant to give hope when a loved one is far away. When that same relationship is brought to an end by distance, we hear, “ Out sight, out of mind “.Proverbs have lasted for thousands of years, probably because they’re so memorable. Some are short and concise, like “ Practice makes perfect “ and “ Haste makes waste “, while others use a poetic language such as metaphors, repetition, and rhymes. The metaphors “ Out of the frying pan and into the fire “ is easy to visualize when you are faced with a difficult situation that just got even worse. The repetition of consonant “ t “ makes it easy to remember “ It takes two to tango “. The rhyme “ When the cat’s away, the mice will play “, comes to mind as soon as possible as the boss leaves on vacation, and the repetition of the structure in “ Once bitten, twice shy “, makes this an extremely catchy phrase.Some scholars who study proverb look for example that are unique to a particular culture as a key to understanding cultural differences. Others focus on the proverbs that appears in almost every language as away of defining a common wisdom that bids all humans together,Proverbs don’t always offer up universal truth, however, and they are frequently contradictory. People say , “ Clothes make the man “, to reflect the importance of appearance as part of one’s personal identity. On the other hand, they also say, “ You can judge a book by its cover “, to point out that appearances can be deceptive. And with “ Handsome is a handsome does”, they stress the value of good behavior over good looks.So while proverb can help us grasp some universally shared wisdom, they also force us to recognize that life is complex and there are no easy answer. The complexity of the human condition as reflected in proverb is yet another thing that is shared by people around the world.QUESTIONS1.According to the text, what are proverbs?2.Why have proverbs lasted for thousands of years ?3.Some proverbs use a poetic language such metaphor, repetition, and rhyme.

                                            The North Wind's Gifts
Once upon a time there was a woman who had one son. As she was old and feeble, her son had to go to the store-house to fetch the meal for their porridge.
As he was leaving the store-house with a bag of meal on his back, up came the North Wind puffing and blowing. He caught up the meal and away he went with it through the air.
The lad went back into the store-house for more; but when he came out again on the steps, the North Wind carried off the meal as he had done before. More than that, he did so the third time.
At this the lad became very angry and made up his mind to go and see the Nor Wind, so that he might ask him to give bad the meal.
The way was long and he walked and walked but at last he came to the North Wind's house ' Good-day,' said the lad, 'and thank you for coming to see us yesterday.'
Good-day,' answered the North Wind. and his voice was loud and gruff. ' Thanks for coming to see me. What do you want? '
'Oh,' replied the lad, ' I only wished to ask you to give me back the meal which you took from me yesterday. You see we haven't much to live on, and if you snap up the little that we have, we shall starve without a doubt.'
I haven't got your meal,' declared the North Wind. ' However, if you are in such need, here is a cloth which will provide everything you want if you only say, " Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes! "
The lad was very well pleased at this. As the way home was long and he could not reach there in one day, he turned into an inn for the night. When he was going to sit down the supper, he laid the cloth on a table in the cornea and said, ' Cloth, spread yourself and serve up all kinds of good dishes! '
He had scarcely spoken when the cloth did as it was bidden. The table was covered wit splendid food of every kind.
All who stood by thought what a fine clot this was, but most of all the inn-keeper's wife So in the middle of the night when everyone was fast asleep, she took the lad's cloth an put another just like it in its place. Yet the cloth could not serve up so much as a bit of dry bread.
When the lad woke he took the cloth an went off with it, and that day he reached his mother's home.
' Now,' said he, ' I've been to the North Wind's house. A good fellow he is too, for he gave me this cloth. When I say to it, " Cloth, spread yourself and serve up all kinds of goo dishes! " it provides any sort of food I want,
' All very true I dare say,' said his mother but I shall not believe it till I see it.'
So the lad made haste, laid the cloth on the table and said, ' Cloth, spread yourself an serve up all kinds of good dishes! ' Yet never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
' Did I not say that seeing is believing said the boy's mother.

A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion’s nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her. “Spare me!” begged the poor Mouse. “Please let me go and someday I will surely repay you.” The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go. Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter’s net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free. “You laughed when I said I would repay you,” said the Mouse. “Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion.”   How did the mouse save the lion? ​</a>

At once they began to prepare for his trip.Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town.“There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”“Here I am, at your feet.”“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”“Please let me be your retainer.”“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee.“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.”“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever aftertentukan :1.orientation2.complication3.resolution</a>

                                            The Monkey and The Crocodile
monkey-crocodile
Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived in a tree that bore juicy, red rose apples. He was very happy. One fine day, a crocodile swam up to that tree and told the monkey that he had traveled a long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry. The kind monkey offered him a few rose apples. The crocodile enjoyed them very much and asked the monkey whether he could come again for some more fruit. The generous monkey happily agreed.
The crocodile returned the next day. And the next. And the next one after that. Soon the two became very good friends. They discussed their lives, their friends and family, like all friends do. The crocodile told the monkey that he had a wife and that they lived on the other side of the river. So the kind monkey offered him some extra rose apples to take home to his wife. The crocodile’s wife loved the rose apples and made her husband promise to get her some every day.
Meanwhile, the friendship between the monkey and the crocodile deepened as they spent more and more time together. The crocodile’s wife started getting jealous. She wanted to put an end to this friendship. So she pretended that she could not believe that her husband could be friends with a monkey. Her husband tried to convince her that he and the monkey shared a true friendship. The crocodile’s wife thought to herself that if the monkey lived on a diet of rose monkeys, his flesh would be very sweet. So she asked the crocodile to invite the monkey to their house.
The crocodile was not happy about this. He tried to make the excuse that it would be difficult to get the monkey across the river. But his wife was determined to eat the monkey’s flesh. So she thought of a plan. One day, she pretended to be very ill and told the crocodile that the doctor said that she would only recover if she ate a monkey’s heart. If her husband wanted to save her life, he must bring her his friend’s heart.
The crocodile was aghast. He was in a dilemma. On the one hand, he loved his friend. On the other, he could not possibly let his wife die. The crocodile’s wife threatened him saying that if he did not get her the monkey’s heart, she would surely die.
So the crocodile went to the rose apple tree and invited the monkey to come home to meet his wife. He told the monkey that he could ride across the river on the crocodile’s back. The monkey happily agreed. As they reached the middle of the river, the crocodile began to sink. The frightened monkey asked him why he was doing that. The crocodile explained that he would have to kill the monkey to save his wife’s life. The clever monkey told him that he would gladly give up his heart to save the life of the crocodile’s wife, but he had left his heart behind in the rose apple tree. He asked the crocodile to make haste and turn back so that the monkey could go get his heart from the apple tree.
The silly crocodile quickly swam back to the rose apple tree. The monkey scampered up the tree to safety. He told the crocodile to tell his wicked wife that she had married the biggest fool in the world.

The North Wind's Gifts
Once upon a time there was a woman who had one son. As she was old and feeble, her son had to go to the store-house to fetch the meal for their porridge.
As he was leaving the store-house with a bag of meal on his back, up came the North Wind puffing and blowing. He caught up the meal and away he went with it through the air.
The lad went back into the store-house for more; but when he came out again on the steps, the North Wind carried off the meal as he had done before. More than that, he did so the third time.
At this the lad became very angry and made up his mind to go and see the Nor Wind, so that he might ask him to give bad the meal.
The way was long and he walked and walked but at last he came to the North Wind's house ' Good-day,' said the lad, 'and thank you for coming to see us yesterday.'
Good-day,' answered the North Wind. and his voice was loud and gruff. ' Thanks for coming to see me. What do you want? '
'Oh,' replied the lad, ' I only wished to ask you to give me back the meal which you took from me yesterday. You see we haven't much to live on, and if you snap up the little that we have, we shall starve without a doubt.'
I haven't got your meal,' declared the North Wind. ' However, if you are in such need, here is a cloth which will provide everything you want if you only say, " Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes! "
The lad was very well pleased at this. As the way home was long and he could not reach there in one day, he turned into an inn for the night. When he was going to sit down the supper, he laid the cloth on a table in the cornea and said, ' Cloth, spread yourself and serve up all kinds of good dishes! '
He had scarcely spoken when the cloth did as it was bidden. The table was covered wit splendid food of every kind.
All who stood by thought what a fine clot this was, but most of all the inn-keeper's wife So in the middle of the night when everyone was fast asleep, she took the lad's cloth an put another just like it in its place. Yet the cloth could not serve up so much as a bit of dry bread.
When the lad woke he took the cloth an went off with it, and that day he reached his mother's home.
' Now,' said he, ' I've been to the North Wind's house. A good fellow he is too, for he gave me this cloth. When I say to it, " Cloth, spread yourself and serve up all kinds of goo dishes! " it provides any sort of food I want,
' All very true I dare say,' said his mother but I shall not believe it till I see it.'
So the lad made haste, laid the cloth on the table and said, ' Cloth, spread yourself an serve up all kinds of good dishes! ' Yet never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
' Did I not say that seeing is believing said the boy's mother.

Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday.
One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!” 
They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”
“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said. 
They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger.
“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy.
Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.
One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.
Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.
“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.
“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off. Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …
At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town.
“There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.
“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.
” The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”
“Here I am, at your feet.”
“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”
“Please let me be your retainer.”
“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”
“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee.
“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.”
“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm.
“I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.
The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.
One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.
Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.
“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.
“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.
“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.
“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”
And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi. 
The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</a>

                                            The Hunter, the Fox, and the TigerA certain hunter saw in the middle of a field a fox, whose skin was so beautiful that he was inspired with a great desire to take him alive. Having this in view, he found out his hole, and just before the entrance to it, he dug a large and deep pit, which he covered with slender twigs and straw, and placed a piece of horseflesh in the middle of it. When he had done this, he went and hid himself in a corner out of sight and the Fox, returning to his hole and smelling the flesh, ran up to see what dainty morsel it was. When he came to the pit, he would fain have tasted the meat, but fearing some tricks he refrained from doing so, and retreated into his hole. Presently up came a hungry tiger who being tempted by the smell and appearance of the horseflesh, sprang in haste to seize it, and tumbled into the pit. The hunter, hearing the noise made by the Tiger in falling, ran up and jumped into the pit without looking into it, never doubting that it was the Fox that had fallen in. But there, to his surprise, he found Tiger, which quickly tore him in pieces and devoured him.What is the purpose of the text above?a.To entertain the readersb. To explain about natural phenomenac.

A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her."Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free."You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse.

Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her."Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free."You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion."Bantuin bikin direct speech ke indirect speech tolong</h2><br />

                            9. tolong bantuin isi ya.. ini teks nya..Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday. One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!” “We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said. They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger. “Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy. Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said. become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip. Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits. “I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town. “There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.” At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace. “Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?” “Here I am, at your feet.” “Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?” “Please let me be your retainer.” “I wonder if your very small body can do anything.” “I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee. “Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.” “Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong. One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess.“Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi. Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer. “Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked. “Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry. “Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said. “Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wishthat I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!” And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</h2><br />

                        <p>﻿ini yaa udah aku artiin, semoga membantu! </p><p></p><p>Pada suatu ketika tinggallah sepasang suami istri yang tidak memiliki anak. Mereka tinggal di sebuah rumah kecil di dekat hutan desa. "Kami mohon, berikan kami anak," pinta mereka kepada Tuhan setiap hari. </p><p></p><p>﻿Suatu hari, mereka mendengar sebuah tangisan dari altar Shinto mereka. "Waa! Waa!" Terlihat seorang bayi yang sedang menangis dan berukuran sebesar jari kecil. "Bayi ini pastilah karunia dari Tuhan! Terima kasih, Tuhan! "Kita akan menamakannya 'Issumboshi'," ujar mereka. </p><p></p><p>﻿Mereka merawat Issumboshi dengan penuh kasih sayang, tetapi Ia tidak juga tumbuh besar. "Hei Issumboshi, apa kau mau dimakan oleh katak?" Issumboshi selalu dirundung oleh anak-anak desa dan selalu pulang dengan sedih. Biasanya Nenek membuatkannya bola-bola nasi besar dan menyemangatinya. "Makanlah yang banyak, dan tumbuhlah cepat," kata sang Nenek. </p><p></p><p>Suatu hari, Issumboshi berkata, "aku akan pergi ke ibukota untuk belajar dan menjadi orang terhormat. Lalu, aku akan kembali," Kakek dan Nenek merasa khawatir, tapi pikiran Issumboshi sudah mantap. Dengan segera mereka mulai mempersiapkan perjalanannya.</p><p></p><p>Issumboshi menyarungkan pedang jarumnya, mengenakan cangkir sebagai topinya, dan keluar dengan sumpit sebagai tongkatnya, dengan semangat yang tinggi. "Aku akan berangkat sekarang," ujar Issumboshi.</p><p></p><p>"Akankah dia tetap aman? Dengan badannya yang kecil?" Tanya Kakek dan Nenek saat mereka melihatnya pergi. Issumboshi berangkat dengan harapan yang besar dalam tubuh kecilnya.</p><p></p><p>Akhirnya Issumboshi sampai di ibukota dan berlabuh di bawah jembatan. Lalu Ia memanjat pagar dan memandang kota tersebut. "Ada istana yang indah disana. Aku harus bertanya kepada orang disana." </p><p></p><p>Tak lama kemudian Issumboshi sampai di istana. "Permisi, saya ingin bertemu dengan Raja." Sang Raja membuka pintu," apa? Siapa disana?" "Saya disini, di kaki Tuan." "Oh. Betapa kecilnya kau! Mengapa kau mau menemuiku?" "Saya ingin menjadi pelayan Tuan." "Saya ragu apakah tubuhmu yang sangat kecil memungkinkanmu melakukan tugas itu." "Saya akan tinggal di saku Tuan dan menjaga Tuan dari bahaya."</p><p></p><p>Ketika Issumboshi berkata demikian, seekor lebah terbang mendekati mereka. "Yhaa!" Jerit Issumboshi, menusuk lebah tersebut. "Hebat! Kau diterima. Akan baik jika kau menjadi pelayan Putri." "Oh! Betapa imutnya dia!" Ujar sang Putri, sembari meletakkan Issumboshi pada telapak tangannya. "Saya akan melindungi Putri dengan segenap jiwa," ujar Issumboshi.</p><p></p><p>Sang Putri menyukai Issumboshi, dan Ia mengajarkannya membaca, menulis, dan berbagai ilmu lain. Selanjutnya, Issumboshi berlatih anggar dengan tekun agar dapat menjadi kuat.</p><p></p><p>Suatu hari, sang Putri pergi berdoa ke Kuil Kiyomizu. Tiba-tiba angin berhembus dengan sangat kencang, dan beberapa iblis muncul. Pemimpin iblis berusaha menangkap sang Putri. "Tolong aku!" Teriaknya. Issumboshi berusaha membantunya, tetapi iblis itu menangkapnya dan melemparnya kedalam mulutnya. Issumboshi, yang sudah ditelan, menusuk dan menusuk perut iblis tersebut. Iblis itu terguling dan memuntahkannya. Issumboshi melompat dan menusuk matanya.</p><p></p><p>Iblis-iblis lain ketakutan. Mereka melarikan diri tergesa-gesa, tetapi ada satu iblis yang tertinggal, bergemetar sambil memegang sebuah palu ajaib. "Apa kau mau aku menusuk matamu juga?" Tanya Issumboshi. "Tolong jangan. Ini adalah palu ajaib yang dapat mengabulkan permintaan. Saya berikan kepadamu, jadi tolong ampuni saya." Setelah itu, Ia melarikan diri. </p><p></p><p>"Terima kasih, Issumboshi. Kau sudah menyelamatkan hidupku," ucap sang Putri. "Putri, tolong ayunkan palu ini dan buatlah permintaan supaya saya menjadi besar," ujar Issumboshi. Putri mengayunkan palu dan memohon, "semoga Issumboshi menjadi besar!" Dengan ajaib, di depan matanya, Issumboshi menjadi besar. Mereka kembali ke istana, dan sang Putri meminta Raja mengizinkannya menikahi Issumboshi.</p><p></p><p>Sang Putri dan Issumboshi kemudian menikah, lalu mereka mengajak Kakek dan Nenek untuk tinggal bersama mereka di istana. Mereka pun hidup bahagia selama-lamanya. </p><br />

                            12. tolong yg bisa menjawab soal tersebut tolong dibantu?.maaf kalo kurang jelas,adanya ky gituOnce upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday.One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger.“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy.Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town.“There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”“Here I am, at your feet.”“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”“Please let me be your retainer.”“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee.“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.”“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm. “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</h2><br />

                        <p>Berikut adalah <strong>jawaban </strong>dari pertanyaan mengenai <strong>proverbs</strong> di atas:</p><strong>A. Note and reflect upon something in order to thoroughly assimilate it.</strong><strong>B. If you get married too quickly, you may spend your whole life regretting it.</strong><strong>C. A good memory is very precious.</strong><strong>E. Women give a house its comfort and character.</strong><strong>A. If the penalty is going to be same, you might as well commit the greater offense.</strong><p>Kita mengenal istilah <strong>proverbs</strong><strong> </strong>di<strong> </strong>dalam bahasa Indonesia sebagai pepatah/peribahasa. Sama halnya dengan pepatah/peribahasa, proverbs memiliki <strong>pesan penting di dalamnya</strong> yang disampaikan melalui untaian kata-kata yang indah.</p><p></p>Pembahasan<p>Berikut adalah penjelasan dari soal-soal di atas:</p><strong>Mark, learn, and inwardly digest</strong> menurut <strong>Farlex Dictionary of Idioms</strong> adalah sebuah pepatah yang biasanya terdapat pada halaman awal buku-buku Doa. Maknanya adalah untuk si pembaca kitab agar memperhatikan, merefleksikan, dan juga memaknai doa dengan sepenuhnya. Untuk menentukan <strong>makna </strong>dari sebuah <strong>proverbs</strong>, kita dapat memperhatikan persamaan kata/<strong>sinonimnya</strong>. Kata <strong>mark</strong><strong> </strong>(menandai/memperhatikan) memiliki <strong>makna yang sama</strong> dengan kata <strong>note </strong>(mencatat/memperhatikan). Maka pilihan A merupakan jawaban yang tepat.<strong>Marry in haste, repent as leisure</strong> menurut <strong>Cambridge Dictionary</strong> adalah sebuah pepatah yang bermakna apabila kamu menikahi seseorang tanpa mengetahui pasanganmu dengan baik, maka kamu kelak akan menyesal sudah menikahnya. Sama dengan soal sebelumnya, carilah sinonim dari proverbs tersebut. Kata <strong>haste</strong><strong> </strong>(bergegas/menyegerakan) memiliki <strong>makna yang sama</strong> dengan kata <strong>quickly</strong><strong> </strong>(segera). Maka pilihan B adalah jawaban yang tepat.<strong>Memory is the treasure of the mind</strong> merupakan sebuah pepatah yang dipersingkat milik <strong>Thomas Fuller </strong>seorang pendeta dan sejarawan Inggris yang dikutip dari bukunya yang berjudul <strong>The Holy State and the Profane State</strong>. Fuller menuliskan "Memory is the treasure house of the mind wherein the monuments thereof are kept and preserved." yang maknanya adalah memori/ingatan adalah harta karun yang disimpan dan dijaga di dalam pikiran kita. Kata <strong>treasure</strong><strong> </strong>yang bermakna harta karun merupakan sesuatu yang <strong>berharga</strong>, maka kata <strong>precious</strong> adalah sinonimnya. Jadi pilihan C merupakan jawaban yang tepat.<strong>Men make houses, women make homes </strong>menurut Farlex Dictionary of Idioms adalah sebuah <strong>pepatah lama</strong> yang bermakna laki-laki diasosiasikan untuk cenderung lebih mementingkan kontruksi dari sebuah rumah, sedangkan perempuan cenderung lebih mementingkan bagaimana rumah tersebut terasa nyaman dengan dekorasi dan sebagainya. Untuk menerjemahkan proverbs ini, hanya perlu mengetahui perbedaan makna antara kata house dan home. Meskipun sama-sama bermakna rumah, tapi <strong>home </strong>merupakan <strong>rumah tempat tinggal</strong>, sedangkan <strong>house </strong>adalah <strong>istilah rumah secara umum</strong>. Maka pilihan E merupakan jawaban yang tepat.<strong>Might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb </strong>menurut Farlex Dictionary of Idioms adalah sebuah pepatah yang bermakna seseorang seharusnya melakukan kejahatan yang lebih buruk jika mendapatkan hukuman yang sama beratnya. Karena pada masa lampau, pencuri domba akan mendapat hukuman gantung. Kata kunci yang dapat digunakan pada pepatah tersebut adalah <strong>as well </strong>(juga), yang terdapat pada soal dan juga pilihan jawaban A.<p></p>Pelajari lebih lanjutMateri tentang proverbs https://brainly.co.id/tugas/15826284Materi tentang proverbs dan idioms brainly.co.id/tugas/15676773Materi tentang contoh soal proverbs brainly.co.id/tugas/2854205<p></p>Detail jawaban<p><strong>Kelas: </strong>10</p><p><strong>Mapel:</strong> Bahasa Inggris</p><p><strong>Bab: </strong>Proverbs</p><p><strong>Kode:</strong> -</p><p></p><p><strong>#AyoBelajar #SPJ2</strong></p><br />

Find the meaning of the bolded words Then answer the questions!Proverbs exist in every language and culture and are a way of passing down folk wisdom, or “ common sense “, from generation to generation. Who doesn’t remember a time when they were struggling with a problem or dilemma, and someone quoted a proverb that aptly summed up or explained the situation? “ All’s fair in love and war “, describe the injustice that is often encountered in romantic relationship and may help some of us accept it. “ Absence makes the heart grow fonder “, its meant to give hope when a loved one is far away. When that same relationship is brought to an end by distance, we hear, “ Out sight, out of mind “.Proverbs have lasted for thousands of years, probably because they’re so memorable. Some are short and concise, like “ Practice makes perfect “ and “ Haste makes waste “, while others use a poetic language such as metaphors, repetition, and rhymes. The metaphors “ Out of the frying pan and into the fire “ is easy to visualize when you are faced with a difficult situation that just got even worse. The repetition of consonant “ t “ makes it easy to remember “ It takes two to tango “. The rhyme “ When the cat’s away, the mice will play “, comes to mind as soon as possible as the boss leaves on vacation, and the repetition of the structure in “ Once bitten, twice shy “, makes this an extremely catchy phrase.Some scholars who study proverb look for example that are unique to a particular culture as a key to understanding cultural differences. Others focus on the proverbs that appears in almost every language as away of defining a common wisdom that bids all humans together,Proverbs don’t always offer up universal truth, however, and they are frequently contradictory. People say , “ Clothes make the man “, to reflect the importance of appearance as part of one’s personal identity. On the other hand, they also say, “ You can judge a book by its cover “, to point out that appearances can be deceptive. And with “ Handsome is a handsome does”, they stress the value of good behavior over good looks.So while proverb can help us grasp some universally shared wisdom, they also force us to recognize that life is complex and there are no easy answer. The complexity of the human condition as reflected in proverb is yet another thing that is shared by people around the world.QUESTIONS1.According to the text, what are proverbs?2.Why have proverbs lasted for thousands of years ?3.Some proverbs use a poetic language such metaphor, repetition, and rhyme.

                            16. The North Wind's Gifts
Once upon a time there was a woman who had one son. As she was old and feeble, her son had to go to the store-house to fetch the meal for their porridge.
As he was leaving the store-house with a bag of meal on his back, up came the North Wind puffing and blowing. He caught up the meal and away he went with it through the air.
The lad went back into the store-house for more; but when he came out again on the steps, the North Wind carried off the meal as he had done before. More than that, he did so the third time.
At this the lad became very angry and made up his mind to go and see the Nor Wind, so that he might ask him to give bad the meal.
The way was long and he walked and walked but at last he came to the North Wind's house ' Good-day,' said the lad, 'and thank you for coming to see us yesterday.'
Good-day,' answered the North Wind. and his voice was loud and gruff. ' Thanks for coming to see me. What do you want? '
'Oh,' replied the lad, ' I only wished to ask you to give me back the meal which you took from me yesterday. You see we haven't much to live on, and if you snap up the little that we have, we shall starve without a doubt.'
I haven't got your meal,' declared the North Wind. ' However, if you are in such need, here is a cloth which will provide everything you want if you only say, " Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes! "
The lad was very well pleased at this. As the way home was long and he could not reach there in one day, he turned into an inn for the night. When he was going to sit down the supper, he laid the cloth on a table in the cornea and said, ' Cloth, spread yourself and serve up all kinds of good dishes! '
He had scarcely spoken when the cloth did as it was bidden. The table was covered wit splendid food of every kind.
All who stood by thought what a fine clot this was, but most of all the inn-keeper's wife So in the middle of the night when everyone was fast asleep, she took the lad's cloth an put another just like it in its place. Yet the cloth could not serve up so much as a bit of dry bread.
When the lad woke he took the cloth an went off with it, and that day he reached his mother's home.
' Now,' said he, ' I've been to the North Wind's house. A good fellow he is too, for he gave me this cloth. When I say to it, " Cloth, spread yourself and serve up all kinds of goo dishes! " it provides any sort of food I want,
' All very true I dare say,' said his mother but I shall not believe it till I see it.'
So the lad made haste, laid the cloth on the table and said, ' Cloth, spread yourself an serve up all kinds of good dishes! ' Yet never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
' Did I not say that seeing is believing said the boy's mother.

A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion’s nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her. “Spare me!” begged the poor Mouse. “Please let me go and someday I will surely repay you.” The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go. Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter’s net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free. “You laughed when I said I would repay you,” said the Mouse. “Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion.”   How did the mouse save the lion? ​</h2><br />

Seekor Tikus kecil yang pemalu mendatanginya secara tak terduga, dan dalam ketakutan dan tergesa-gesa untuk melarikan diri, berlari melintasi hidung Singa. Terbangun dari tidur siangnya, Singa meletakkan cakar besarnya dengan marah pada makhluk kecil itu untuk membunuhnya. "Lepaskan aku!" pinta Tikus yang malang. "Tolong biarkan aku pergi dan suatu hari nanti aku pasti akan membalasmu." Singa sangat geli untuk berpikir bahwa Tikus bisa membantunya. Tapi dia murah hati dan akhirnya membiarkan Mouse pergi. Beberapa hari kemudian, saat mengintai mangsanya di hutan, Singa terjerat jaring pemburu. Tidak dapat membebaskan dirinya sendiri, dia memenuhi hutan dengan aumannya yang marah. Tikus tahu suara itu dan dengan cepat menemukan Singa berjuang di jaring. Berlari ke salah satu tali besar yang mengikatnya, dia menggerogotinya sampai terlepas, dan segera Singa itu bebas. "Kamu tertawa ketika aku berkata aku akan membalasmu," kata Tikus. "Sekarang kamu melihat bahwa bahkan seekor Tikus dapat membantu seekor Singa." Bagaimana cara tikus menyelamatkan singa?</p><br />

I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”“Here I am, at your feet.”“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”“Please let me be your retainer.”“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee.“Bravo!

The remaining demons were frightened.

This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man.

                            21. The Monkey and The Crocodile
monkey-crocodile
Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived in a tree that bore juicy, red rose apples. He was very happy. One fine day, a crocodile swam up to that tree and told the monkey that he had traveled a long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry. The kind monkey offered him a few rose apples. The crocodile enjoyed them very much and asked the monkey whether he could come again for some more fruit. The generous monkey happily agreed.
The crocodile returned the next day. And the next. And the next one after that. Soon the two became very good friends. They discussed their lives, their friends and family, like all friends do. The crocodile told the monkey that he had a wife and that they lived on the other side of the river. So the kind monkey offered him some extra rose apples to take home to his wife. The crocodile’s wife loved the rose apples and made her husband promise to get her some every day.
Meanwhile, the friendship between the monkey and the crocodile deepened as they spent more and more time together. The crocodile’s wife started getting jealous. She wanted to put an end to this friendship. So she pretended that she could not believe that her husband could be friends with a monkey. Her husband tried to convince her that he and the monkey shared a true friendship. The crocodile’s wife thought to herself that if the monkey lived on a diet of rose monkeys, his flesh would be very sweet. So she asked the crocodile to invite the monkey to their house.
The crocodile was not happy about this. He tried to make the excuse that it would be difficult to get the monkey across the river. But his wife was determined to eat the monkey’s flesh. So she thought of a plan. One day, she pretended to be very ill and told the crocodile that the doctor said that she would only recover if she ate a monkey’s heart. If her husband wanted to save her life, he must bring her his friend’s heart.
The crocodile was aghast. He was in a dilemma. On the one hand, he loved his friend. On the other, he could not possibly let his wife die. The crocodile’s wife threatened him saying that if he did not get her the monkey’s heart, she would surely die.
So the crocodile went to the rose apple tree and invited the monkey to come home to meet his wife. He told the monkey that he could ride across the river on the crocodile’s back. The monkey happily agreed. As they reached the middle of the river, the crocodile began to sink. The frightened monkey asked him why he was doing that. The crocodile explained that he would have to kill the monkey to save his wife’s life. The clever monkey told him that he would gladly give up his heart to save the life of the crocodile’s wife, but he had left his heart behind in the rose apple tree. He asked the crocodile to make haste and turn back so that the monkey could go get his heart from the apple tree.
The silly crocodile quickly swam back to the rose apple tree. The monkey scampered up the tree to safety. He told the crocodile to tell his wicked wife that she had married the biggest fool in the world.

Ini adalah palu ajaib yang akan memberikan Anda sebuah keinginan. Saya memberikannya kepada Anda, jadi silakan cadangan saya. "Dan mengatakan ini, dia lari terburu-buru." Terima kasih, Issumboshi. Anda telah menyelamatkan hidup saya, "kata Putri." Putri, silakan gelombang palu ajaib ini dan membuat keinginan bahwa saya bisa menjadi besar, "kata Issumboshi.

Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like alittle figer. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshinever grew bigger.“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?”Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the villageand often went home feeling unhappy.Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encouragehim. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study andbecome a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfatherand Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mindwould not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, puton a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, inhigh spirits.“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe?

The North Wind's Gifts
Once upon a time there was a woman who had one son. As she was old and feeble, her son had to go to the store-house to fetch the meal for their porridge.
As he was leaving the store-house with a bag of meal on his back, up came the North Wind puffing and blowing. He caught up the meal and away he went with it through the air.
The lad went back into the store-house for more; but when he came out again on the steps, the North Wind carried off the meal as he had done before. More than that, he did so the third time.
At this the lad became very angry and made up his mind to go and see the Nor Wind, so that he might ask him to give bad the meal.
The way was long and he walked and walked but at last he came to the North Wind's house ' Good-day,' said the lad, 'and thank you for coming to see us yesterday.'
Good-day,' answered the North Wind. and his voice was loud and gruff. ' Thanks for coming to see me. What do you want? '
'Oh,' replied the lad, ' I only wished to ask you to give me back the meal which you took from me yesterday. You see we haven't much to live on, and if you snap up the little that we have, we shall starve without a doubt.'
I haven't got your meal,' declared the North Wind. ' However, if you are in such need, here is a cloth which will provide everything you want if you only say, " Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes! "
The lad was very well pleased at this. As the way home was long and he could not reach there in one day, he turned into an inn for the night. When he was going to sit down the supper, he laid the cloth on a table in the cornea and said, ' Cloth, spread yourself and serve up all kinds of good dishes! '
He had scarcely spoken when the cloth did as it was bidden. The table was covered wit splendid food of every kind.
All who stood by thought what a fine clot this was, but most of all the inn-keeper's wife So in the middle of the night when everyone was fast asleep, she took the lad's cloth an put another just like it in its place. Yet the cloth could not serve up so much as a bit of dry bread.
When the lad woke he took the cloth an went off with it, and that day he reached his mother's home.
' Now,' said he, ' I've been to the North Wind's house. A good fellow he is too, for he gave me this cloth. When I say to it, " Cloth, spread yourself and serve up all kinds of goo dishes! " it provides any sort of food I want,
' All very true I dare say,' said his mother but I shall not believe it till I see it.'
So the lad made haste, laid the cloth on the table and said, ' Cloth, spread yourself an serve up all kinds of good dishes! ' Yet never a bit of dry bread did the cloth serve up.
' Did I not say that seeing is believing said the boy's mother.

Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday.
One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!” 
They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”
“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said. 
They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger.
“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy.
Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.
One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.
Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.
“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.
“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off. Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …
At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town.
“There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.
“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.
” The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”
“Here I am, at your feet.”
“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”
“Please let me be your retainer.”
“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”
“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee.
“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.”
“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm.
“I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.
The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.
One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.
Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.
“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.
“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.
“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.
“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”
And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi. 
The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</h2><br />

                            30. The Hunter, the Fox, and the TigerA certain hunter saw in the middle of a field a fox, whose skin was so beautiful that he was inspired with a great desire to take him alive. Having this in view, he found out his hole, and just before the entrance to it, he dug a large and deep pit, which he covered with slender twigs and straw, and placed a piece of horseflesh in the middle of it. When he had done this, he went and hid himself in a corner out of sight and the Fox, returning to his hole and smelling the flesh, ran up to see what dainty morsel it was. When he came to the pit, he would fain have tasted the meat, but fearing some tricks he refrained from doing so, and retreated into his hole. Presently up came a hungry tiger who being tempted by the smell and appearance of the horseflesh, sprang in haste to seize it, and tumbled into the pit. The hunter, hearing the noise made by the Tiger in falling, ran up and jumped into the pit without looking into it, never doubting that it was the Fox that had fallen in. But there, to his surprise, he found Tiger, which quickly tore him in pieces and devoured him.What is the purpose of the text above?a.To entertain the readersb. To explain about natural phenomenac.

Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her."Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free."You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse.

The Hunter, the Fox, and the TigerA certain hunter saw in the middle of a field a fox, whose skin was so beautiful that he was inspired with a great desire to take him alive. Having this in view, he found out his hole, and just before the entrance to it, he dug a large and deep pit, which he covered with slender twigs and straw, and placed a piece of horseflesh in the middle of it. When he had done this, he went and hid himself in a corner out of sight and the Fox, returning to his hole and smelling the flesh, ran up to see what dainty morsel it was. When he came to the pit, he would fain have tasted the meat, but fearing some tricks he refrained from doing so, and retreated into his hole. Presently up came a hungry tiger who being tempted by the smell and appearance of the horseflesh, sprang in haste to seize it, and tumbled into the pit. The hunter, hearing the noise made by the Tiger in falling, ran up and jumped into the pit without looking into it, never doubting that it was the Fox that had fallen in. But there, to his surprise, he found Tiger, which quickly tore him in pieces and devoured him.Why did the hunter want to take the Fox alive? Because …a. The Fox is very nice to himb. The fox had defeated the.   Tigerc. The Fox had beautiful skind. The Tiger wanted to attack the Foxe. The Fox had saved the hunter​</h2><br />
