Remember I had been designing games on my own for twenty years before then.Brian: Where do you start when inventing a new game? Reiner: Well, you can't always start at the same corner, or you'll always end up in the same corner. That's the problem with game design - there is no consistent approach. Taking the same approach goes against creativity. Game design really is an art, not a science. You can't apply the same methodology or you'll come up with the same type of game.Brian: What do you do if you have trouble selling a certain game?Reiner: If the publishers don't like it. I rework it. I have only a handful of games that 4) (not, sell)___, and for those I feel probably it's the right thing they aren't published. Publishers are a good second opinion on how good a game is, and I really wouldn't want my name on a game that's not very good. I'm a perfectionist and I stand behind all the games 15) (publish)___.Brian: What are some of the problems you've 6) (have)___to overcome in inventing new games?Reiner: My biggest problem is that I am unable to clone myself (laughing). I have so many ideas. There are so many projects I could do, but there isn't enough time in the week to do them all. It's difficult to choose which ones to work on first. People start stealing my ideas before I even have them.Brian: What's an important lesson you've 7) (feam)___about game inventing?Reiner: Different people expect different things from games. You need to know the audience you're creating the game for. Do they want an easy game with very fast rules for the mass marker. or a deep strategic game for experienced game players? It's important to remember that in the end all that counts is the quality of the game. But the quality criteria change - they are defined by the market.Brian: Where would you recommend a new inventor start when creating a game? Reiner: All that counts that you make a high quality, excellent game. Your profession, money, background, everything else doesn't count. Everything you need will follow if you make a good game. Don't start out thinking about big money. Don't start thinking about self publishing either. You should get a publisher. Publisher are very good at judging games. If a publisher doesn't want your game, probably no one else will either. Designing games is a long procces. You need to get experience by playing lots of diffirent games, talking to people who make and play games, and studying the product lines of companies. I've 8) (do)___games for 35 years and I'm still learning all the time. I still understand very little about what makes a game successful. You can look back on past products and do marketing analysis for explanations of why a game was successful or not. That's all very nice, but it's irrelevant to understanding what's going to succeed in the future.Brian: Is there any more advice you'd like to give new inventors?Reiner: Do what you do best. Follow your own path. Develop your own style. Also, clarify why you are doing it. You need to know your own reason. My reason is in my motto: "Bringing enjoyment to the people." That's why I design games, and for me, that's the only thing that counts.tolong dijawab yg bener!!​</a>

Born in Palestine, Tibawi lectured in ArabEducation at the Institute of Education, University of London. His English SpeakingOrientalists, published in 1964, is a landmark study offering a masterly dissection of thetechniques and methodology of Orientalism. Islamic Education: Its Traditions andModernisation into the Arab National System, provides a concise history of Islamic educationfrom its origins in the seventh century to early attempts at modernisation in the nineteenthcentury, explores the educational theory of Islam, and analyses the problems of modernisationby looking at specific cases - the modern national systems of Iraq, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco,Saudi Arabia and a host of other Middle Eastern states. It is perhaps the first comprehensivestudy of educational problems in the Arab world. The changes, Tibawi laments, are not goodfor 'stimulating thought'.tentukan main idea dan supporting detailsnya dari nomor 8 terimakasih mohon bantuannya​</a>

                            10. Business Economics, also called Managerial Economics, is the application of economic theory and methodology to business. Business involves decision-making. Decision making means the process of selecting one out of two or more alternative courses of action. The question of choice arises because the basic resources such as capital, land, Inbour and management are limited and can be employed in alternative uses. The decision-making function thus becomes one of making choice and taking decisions that will provide the most efficient means of attaining a desired end, say, profit maximation 2.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Methodology is the systematic, theoretical analysis of the methods applied to a field of study. It comprises the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge. Typically, it encompasses concepts such as paradigm, theoretical model, phases and quantitative or qualitative techniques.
</p><p>A methodology does not set out to provide solutions it is therefore, not the same as a method. Instead, a methodology offers the theoretical underpinning for understanding which method, set of methods, or best practices can be applied to a specific case, for example, to calculate a specific result.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            21. Complete the following interview with the suitable verbs!Here is an interview between Brian and Dr. Reiner Knizia, one of the most respected game designers in the industry. With over 100 published titles and dozens and dozens of awards, he is not only one of the most talented, but possibly the most prolific inventor in the world.Brian: How did you 1) (sell)___your first game?Reiner: It was pretty straightforward. 12 (contact)___the publisher and showed them the games and they 3) (like)___them. Remember I had been designing games on my own for twenty years before then.Brian: Where do you start when inventing a new game? Reiner: Well, you can't always start at the same corner, or you'll always end up in the same corner. That's the problem with game design - there is no consistent approach. Taking the same approach goes against creativity. Game design really is an art, not a science. You can't apply the same methodology or you'll come up with the same type of game.Brian: What do you do if you have trouble selling a certain game?Reiner: If the publishers don't like it. I rework it. I have only a handful of games that 4) (not, sell)___, and for those I feel probably it's the right thing they aren't published. Publishers are a good second opinion on how good a game is, and I really wouldn't want my name on a game that's not very good. I'm a perfectionist and I stand behind all the games 15) (publish)___.Brian: What are some of the problems you've 6) (have)___to overcome in inventing new games?Reiner: My biggest problem is that I am unable to clone myself (laughing). I have so many ideas. There are so many projects I could do, but there isn't enough time in the week to do them all. It's difficult to choose which ones to work on first. People start stealing my ideas before I even have them.Brian: What's an important lesson you've 7) (feam)___about game inventing?Reiner: Different people expect different things from games. You need to know the audience you're creating the game for. Do they want an easy game with very fast rules for the mass marker. or a deep strategic game for experienced game players? It's important to remember that in the end all that counts is the quality of the game. But the quality criteria change - they are defined by the market.Brian: Where would you recommend a new inventor start when creating a game? Reiner: All that counts that you make a high quality, excellent game. Your profession, money, background, everything else doesn't count. Everything you need will follow if you make a good game. Don't start out thinking about big money. Don't start thinking about self publishing either. You should get a publisher. Publisher are very good at judging games. If a publisher doesn't want your game, probably no one else will either. Designing games is a long procces. You need to get experience by playing lots of diffirent games, talking to people who make and play games, and studying the product lines of companies. I've 8) (do)___games for 35 years and I'm still learning all the time. I still understand very little about what makes a game successful. You can look back on past products and do marketing analysis for explanations of why a game was successful or not. That's all very nice, but it's irrelevant to understanding what's going to succeed in the future.Brian: Is there any more advice you'd like to give new inventors?Reiner: Do what you do best. Follow your own path. Develop your own style. Also, clarify why you are doing it. You need to know your own reason. My reason is in my motto: "Bringing enjoyment to the people." That's why I design games, and for me, that's the only thing that counts.tolong dijawab yg bener!!​</h2><br />

His English SpeakingOrientalists, published in 1964, is a landmark study offering a masterly dissection of thetechniques and methodology of Orientalism. Islamic Education: Its Traditions andModernisation into the Arab National System, provides a concise history of Islamic educationfrom its origins in the seventh century to early attempts at modernisation in the nineteenthcentury, explores the educational theory of Islam, and analyses the problems of modernisationby looking at specific cases - the modern national systems of Iraq, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco,Saudi Arabia and a host of other Middle Eastern states.
